Estimate the total compensation to be provided to an employee

Imagine you are working as a data scientist in a big organization which has thousands of employees. The HR department is planning to provide some additional compensation to each working employee which needs to be calculated by looking at the profile of each employee and the benefits they are getting. 

The HR department asks your help if you can use your data science and machine learning skills and calculate an estimated ‘Total Compensation’ for each employee.
